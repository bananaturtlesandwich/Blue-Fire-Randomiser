# Blue-Fire-Randomiser
A **very** work-in-progress randomiser for Blue Fire

For a roadmap and my thought process check out the [wiki](https://github.com/bananaturtlesandwich/Blue-Fire-Randomiser/wiki)

Remember this application was written using dotnet 6 so you will need to install the appropriate runtime from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net472) in order to run it

The main dependency of this program is UAssetAPI

# Usage Guide
- Open BlueFireRando.exe and you will be greeted with the menu. 
- Check the boxes which you would like and click randomise once you are satisfied with your choice
- A pak file will be generated
- You will be prompted to select your mod folder - this is Blue Fire/Content/Paks/~mods (if you do not have a ~mods folder in Paks then make one with the new folder button)
- Your modfolder is saved in a file next to the .exe for future reference

# Issues
There is nothing currently-if there is then please report in the issues tab or in the Blue Fire discord (ping spuds)
