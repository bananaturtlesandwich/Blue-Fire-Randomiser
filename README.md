# Blue-Fire-Randomiser
A **very** WIP item randomiser for Blue Fire

For umap editing it uses [uassetAPI](https://github.com/atenfyr/UAssetAPI) by @atenfyr

Planned Features

- [x] Actually does something with the GUI making sense and lookin' pretty
- [ ] Allow support for non-chest items like in shops and in the overworld
- [ ] Allow support for Amazon games build(hopefully this'll becom irrelevant if Blue Fire updates on amazon)
- [ ] Add more customisation to what can be randomised
- [ ] Make it so Key items can can be mixed with tunics, weapons, items, etc.
- [ ] Maybe randomise stats if I deem it necessary
- [ ] Make dash an item
- [ ] Add preventative measures to stop softlocking
