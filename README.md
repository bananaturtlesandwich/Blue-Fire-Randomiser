# Blue-Fire-Randomiser
A **very** work-in-progress randomiser for Blue Fire

Remember this application was written using the dotnet 4.7.2 framework in order to support .uasset file editing in [UAssetAPI](https://github.com/atenfyr/UAssetAPI) by [atenfyr](https://github.com/atenfyr) so you will need to install the appropriate runtime from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net472) in order to run it


# Usage Guide
- Open BlueFireRando.exe and you will be greeted with the menu. 
- Check the boxes which you would like and click randomise once you are satisfied with your choice
- A pak file will be generated
- You will be prompted to select your mod folder - this is Blue Fire/Content/Paks/~mods (if you do not have a ~mods folder in Paks then make one)

# Errors
There is nothing currently-if there is then please report in the issues tab or in the Blue Fire discord(ping spuds#5419)
