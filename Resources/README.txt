Thank you for downloading the Blue Fire randomiser!
At the moment the project is in a very early stage but i plan to continue this for a while.
For use, the dotnet 4.7.2 assembly is required, which can be downloaded here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net472-web-installer
The files uassetAPI.dll, Newtonsoft.json.dll, Unrealpak.exe,Packing.bat,BlueFireRando.exe and the files in the folder Baseassets are all needed in order for the program to function properly.

Open BlueFireRando.exe and you will be greeted with the menu. 
Check the boxes which you would like and click randomise once you are satisfied with your choice
A pak file will be generated and you will be prompted to select your mod folder-this is Blue Fire/Content/Paks/~mods (if you do not have a ~mods folder in Paks then make one)
